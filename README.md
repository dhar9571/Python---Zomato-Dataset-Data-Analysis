Zomato Dataset Data Analysis

**Project Overview**:
This data analysis project is centered around the Zomato dataset, which includes two different datasets: "zomato.csv" and "country_code.csv." The two datasets were merged using the "country_code" column to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. This project seeks to explore and derive insights from the Zomato dataset, which provides information about restaurants, their cuisines, locations, and customer ratings.

**Dataset Details**:

Merging Datasets: The "zomato.csv" and "country_code.csv" datasets were merged based on the "country_code" column.
Unique Values: The merged dataset contains 19 columns and 9,551 rows, and each column presents a specific aspect of restaurant data.
Data Completeness: There are no null values in the dataset, ensuring the reliability of the analysis.

**Key Observations**:

Country-wise Transactions:
-Zomato records the highest number of transactions from India (94.4%), followed by the United States (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (0.9%).
-The dataset reveals that there is potential for expanding services to other countries to improve business presence.

Ratings Analysis:
-The occurrence of a 0.0 rating is notably high, suggesting a need for motivating customers to provide valuable ratings.
-The majority of ratings fall within the range of 2.5 to 3.4, classified as "Average," indicating a requirement to focus on service quality to improve ratings.

Customer Engagement:
Indian customers have given the most "no ratings." Providing special incentives or perks to Indian customers for their ratings can improve customer engagement.

Online Delivery Options:
Only India and the UAE offer online delivery options. Expanding online delivery services to other countries could boost business.

City-wise Transactions:
Delhi accounts for the maximum number of transactions (68.87%), reflecting its high population. However, further increasing transactions can be achieved by providing more offers and incentives.

Cuisine Popularity:
The most popular cuisine is North Indian, suggesting the need for more attention to North Indian food quality to enhance its reputation.

**Conclusion:**
The Zomato dataset analysis provides several valuable insights for improving the platform's services and enhancing customer engagement. Expanding services to countries beyond India, motivating customers to rate their experiences, focusing on service quality, and extending online delivery options to other nations are key areas for improvement. Furthermore, capitalizing on the popularity of North Indian cuisine can enhance Zomato's position in the market. This project equips Zomato with data-driven recommendations to optimize and expand its business operations.
